#Key Insights:



High Training Accuracy: The model achieves an impressive 79.87% accuracy on the training set, indicating good performance on the training data.



Good Validation Accuracy: The model performs better on the validation set with an accuracy of 84.10%, suggesting good generalization to unseen data.



Balanced Precision & Recall: Both the training and validation reports show high precision and recall for all classes, with positive, neutral, and negative sentiments performing consistently well.



Class Imbalance Handling: The model handles the imbalanced nature of the dataset effectively, as evidenced by the reasonable F1 scores across different sentiment classes.



#Assessment:



The model demonstrates strong performance on both the training and validation datasets, with validation accuracy outperforming the training accuracy. This suggests that the model is capable of generalizing well to unseen data, and it does so effectively across all sentiment classes. The precision, recall, and F1 scores for the sentiment categories like "Negative" and "Positive" are particularly notable, reflecting the model's robustness. Furthermore, the model handles the imbalanced class distribution with reasonable effectiveness, as reflected in the macro and weighted averages, which show good balance between precision and recall.
